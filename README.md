## Setting up

> [!WARNING]
> Even though the documentation suggests you can use databases other than SQLite, the code does not support any other database at this moment.

### Manual setup
Requirements:
- Smart editor (like VSCode, to help you edit YAML and JSON files)

Please see [manual setup instructions](./scripts/manual_setup.md).

### Automated setup
Requirements:
- NodeJS
- Smart editor (like VSCode, to help you edit YAML files)

Run `node scripts/setup.js` and follow the instructions.

By default, **evertide** will store its data in a SQLite database. If you wish to change the database, make sure to change the generated `config.yml` file (the schema will help you).

### Development/testing setup
Requirements:
- NodeJS (`node`)
- TypeScript compiler (`tsc`)
- PHP (`php`)

Proceed by instructions for [automated setup](#automated-setup).

If you make any changes to the JS code in _`web/index.ts`_, you will need to run `tsc` in the _`web`_ directory. All other changes to the code take effect immediately.

Run the development server by running
```cmd
php -S localhost[:<port>] ./php/src/router.php
```

### Multiple instances
**evertide** supports running multiple instances on the same infrastructure. If you want to run multiple instances, proceed as normal, but in the automated setup, make sure to respond _yes_ to the multiple instance prompt.

The backend only needs an environment variable called `EVERTIDE_INSTANCE`. Set it to the same value as the domain.

In production, this will be done in the Apache config file
```htaccess
<VirtualHost <address>>
    SetEnv EVERTIDE_INSTANCE "< domain name >"
    ...
</>
```

In development, set it in your shell by running
```sh
EVERTIDE_INSTANCE=<domain> php -S ...
```
or
```ps1
New-Item Env:/EVERTIDE_INSTANCE -Value <domain>
php -S ...
```

Shell 1:
```ps1
node .\scripts\setup.js # Multiple instances: yes, URL: localhost
New-Item Env:/EVERTIDE_INSTANCE -Value "localhost"
php -S localhost:80 .\php\src\router.php
```

Shell 2:
```ps1
node .\scripts\setup.js # Multiple instances: yes, URL: localhost:81
New-Item Env:/EVERTIDE_INSTANCE -Value "localhost:81"
php -S localhost:80 .\php\src\router.php
```
