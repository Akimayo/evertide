  evertide:
    h: What is evertide?
    p:
      ->
        ðŸŒŠ evertide is a self-hosted single-user bookmark manager.
      ->
        It's purpose is twofold, though. Not only does it serve as a categorized bookmark manager for yourself,
        it can also be used for portfolios or curated collections &ndash; each bookmark can be set to be publicly visible.
        Present links to your projects, favourite movies, social media or fun Internet places alongside
        keeping private bookmarks to articles you want to read, videos you want to watch or recipes you want to cook
        from anywhere on the Internet.
      ->
        evertide is trying to uphold the culture of Web 1.0 and promote &ldquo;online gardens&rdquo; (small websites run by
        individuals) without the need for search engines. The evertide app is made with simple technologies, which makes it
        small, fast, reliable and easy to understand. Instances of evertide can link together in a process known
        as &ldquo;federation&rdquo; to make a network of links pointing to many corners of the Internet that search engines
        may not know or tell you about.
  tips:
    title: Tip
    items:
      - evertide can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your phone and links can then be added from the share menu!
      - evertide has a very pretty dark mode!
      - Try adding some links to small online projects. You'll make someones day and make the Internet a better place!
  federation:
    h: Federation
    p:
      ->
        ðŸŒŠ evertide instance owners can choose to present links from a different evertide instance in a process known
        as &ldquo;federation.&rdquo;
      ->
        Federation is opt-in for instance owners. When they enable federation, any category (or rather public links within
        a given category) can be synced to any other evertide instance and be shown there. For example, if instance A wants
        to promote recipes from instance B (and instance B is open for federation), instance A can choose to present the
        category &ldquo;Recipes&rdquo; hosted on instance B and have it shown on instance A's main page along with their
        categories. These &ldquo;remote&rdquo; categories also update automatically, so new links will appear (or disappear)
        as they are added (or removed) on the remote instance.
    open: This instance is open for federation.
    closed: This instance does not allow federation.

          Disclaimer&colon; Instances listed here are not actively endorsed by the owner of this instance. If this instance
          has federation enabled, any other evertide instance can link to it and therefore be listed here. Endorsed are only
          selected categories from remote instances with cards on the main page.
